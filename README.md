### Pricing Model Recommendation

#### Dynamic Pricing Formula
```
Premium = Base Premium × Combined Risk Multiplier
Base Premium = $11.86 (expected claim cost)
```

#### Risk Multipliers by Factor

**1. Airline Multipliers**
- High-risk airlines: 2.0x - 45.0x (SV: 45x, PK: 17x, E8: 5x)
- Medium-risk airlines: 1.0x - 3.0x (FM: 3x, MU: 3x, CZ: 3x)
- Low-risk airlines: 0.5x - 0.8x (default: 0.7x)

**2. Airport Multipliers**
- High-risk arrival airports: 3.0x - 8.0x (SUB: 8x, DOH: 4x, ALA: 3x)
- Standard airports: 1.0x

**3. Temporal Multipliers**
- Summer: 1.35x, Winter: 1.07x, Spring: 1.00x, Fall: 0.60x
- Peak hours (3 AM): 3.6x, Off-peak (8 AM): 0.8x
- Sunday: 1.2x, Thursday: 0.7x

#### Example Premium Calculations

| Flight Type | Airline | Route | Date/Time | Risk Category | Premium |
|-------------|---------|-------|-----------|---------------|---------|
| Low-Risk | Default | HKG → Standard | Monday 2 PM, Fall | Medium | $10.68 |
| Medium-Risk | FM | HKG → PVG | Monday 11 AM, Summer | High | $18.31 |
| High-Risk | SV | HKG → SUB | Sunday 3 AM, Summer | High | $42.34 |
